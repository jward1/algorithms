#Algorithms

I am currently working my way through Robert Sedgewick's and Kevin Waynes' [Algorithms (fourth edition)](http://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-4th-Robert-Sedgewick/dp/032157351X/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1453766122&sr=8-2&keywords=algorithms) textbook, and I have decided to include some of my code here on github. As always, any recommendations to improve my code are welcome.

To compile all of the files in the source directory (```src```), enter the following terminal commands while in the parent directory (```algorithms```)

```
algorithms> find . -name "*.java" > sources.txt
algorithms> javac -d bin -classpath bin -sourcepath src @sources.txt
```
