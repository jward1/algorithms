#Binary Search

This is a very simple script. This program grabs the list of integers in the whitelist.txt file, and then checks to see if any of the inputs in inputs.txt are contained in that whitelist. To run BinarySearch, use the following command in the terminal:
```
javac BinarySearch.java
java BinarySearach whitelist.txt < inputs.txt
```
