#Algorithms

I am currently working my way through Robert Sedgewick's and Kevin Waynes' [Algorithms (fourth edition)](http://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-4th-Robert-Sedgewick/dp/032157351X/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1453766122&sr=8-2&keywords=algorithms) textbook, and I have decided to include some of my code here on github. As always, any recommendations to improve my code are welcome.
